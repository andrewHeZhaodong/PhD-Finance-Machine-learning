# Introduction
This is to introduce the basic of asset pricing and the most frequenctly used database. Some course and resources are provided to be easy access.

Since CAPM model firstly align stock price with the systemic risk(beta), the risk factors have been widely developed. While there are some difference betwwen risk factors and Characteristics. Theory suggests that a true risk factor has
three fundamental attributes [1]:

1. It varies unpredictably in a time-series sense.
2. Its variations induce changes in asset prices.
3. It is associated with a risk premium.

Quasi factors (in the set g) influence the returns of few securities and are unpriced in aggregate. A factor of this type possesses two attributes:

1. It varies unpredictably in a time-series sense.
1. Its variations do not affect expected returns

Characteristics are sometimes associated with factors, but a characteristic
1. is known in advance.
1. might be cross-sectionally related to the expected returns of some assets.
1. might be cross-sectionally related to the loadings on true risk factors or the loadings on quasi factors.
