# PhD-Finance-Machine-learning

# Introduction
This project trys to include almost all necessary knowleges about doing a PhD in Finance using Machine learning. 

As machine learning rapidly merged with traditional social science, it's very attactive apply Machine learning to finance field, especially prediction related problem.

Currently it includes:
  1. The machine learning algorithm and intuitive applications
  1. Related mathematics algorithm. 
  1. Trading strategies
      1. Momentum Strategies
      1. Pair Trading Strategies
  1. Asset pricing 
      1. Retrieve data from WRDS
      1. Common risk factors and firm characteristics

# How to find related reference

Each research filed has it's own trend. Traditional reseach area can directly search the published resourse such as web of science  (www.webofknowledge.com) to creat the personal library. While for some newly estabulised intersection research such as machine learning in finance filed,  papers tend to be in difference area. Publishing papers requies a long time. Researchers would be more willing to published their working paper in some public database such as SSRN and arXiv before it's too late. 

Normally the machine learning in fiance papers can be mostly (not all) found in following places:

1. Working paper in public database: SSRN(more finance papers), arXiv(more computer science paper) and some university owned database(MIT, Chicago booth)
2. Journal paper:
    1. Expert System with Applications
