# PhD-Finance-Machine-learning

# Introduction
This project tries to include almost all necessary knowledge about doing a PhD in Finance using Machine learning. 

As machine learning rapidly merged with traditional social science, it's very attractive to apply Machine learning to finance field, especially prediction related problem.

Currently, it includes:
  1. The machine learning algorithm and intuitive applications
  1. Related mathematics algorithm. 
  1. Trading strategies
      1. Momentum Strategies
      1. Pair Trading Strategies
  1. Asset pricing 
      1. Retrieve data from WRDS
      1. Common risk factors and firm characteristics

A cat lover and a good chef (Chinese Cuisine and Sichuan hotpot). If you find me, I would very like to trest you a special dinner with my personal menue.


# How to find related reference

Each research field has a trend. Traditional research area can directly search the published resources such as the web of science  (www.webofknowledge.com) to create the personal library. While for some newly established intersection research such as machine learning in finance filed,  papers tend to be in different areas. Publishing papers require a long time. Researchers would be more willing to published their working paper in some public database such as SSRN and arXiv before it's too late. 

Normally the machine learning in fiance papers can be mostly (not all) found in the following places:

1. Working papers in public database: SSRN(more finance and social science papers), arXiv(more computer science paper) and some university-owned database(MIT, Chicago booth)

2. Journal paper:
    1. Expert System with Applications (3)
    1. Management Science (4*)
    1. Journal of Financial Economics (4*)
    1. Journal of Emperical Finance (3)
    

As papers are not published in the same journal, I would highly recommend using google scholar as the main reference management website. Of course, you may use the EndNote (if your university offers the free student version), Melody(Free) or other software. But google scholar for me is good enough to support every function required. 

Some functions are extremely useful in google scholar after you sign in your google account.
1. 'Labels': A tag-like button just below the search box. You may category your papers with this tool. Can help you manage the big amount of literature.
1. 'Related Articles': A button under the title of the paper. It may automatically research all related articles to this topic. The result may include all possible working papers, conference papers and journal papers from many fields in the most popular order. It can make one quickly grasp the recent trend and result of one topic.
1. 'Cite': A double-quotation-mark-like button. Generate multiple format citations for Bibtex, EndNote, et al. One can export multiple citations for selected papers by using the 'Export' button below the search box. As I don't use EndNote, the Bibtex format is the most used. 
1. 'Anytime': Some years listed in the left-hand side. We would have more cared about the recently 2 years papers or sometimes the latest published paper. This function filters papers by years. Normally papers within 5 years are comparably new and some working papers within one year are great to learn the hot topics and the most popular issues.



# Choose a editor to write the essay

The most frequently used editor in normal life would be the Word from Microsoft Office. While it's not the best choice for acadimic writing. For my point of view, the only one option for researchers is LaTex which offered the high quality formatting system and makes your papers more professional. You may write your CV, cover letter and even apologies letter to make them proper and formal. The advantage of LaTex is:
1. Easy to manage Bibliography using bib file. The bib file can reuse in the next paper
1. Once get on the board, you will forget about the fear from adjusting the linewith and font style. 
1. Abundant of templates and easy to use with one mouse click.

There are plenty of LaTex editors and what I use is OverLeaf which is a web broswer based online editor. Since all data are uploaded and saved on the cloud. As long as you can find a computer with Wifi, you can start to work. Almost all necessary packages are installed already and you will never worried about the computer crash as it will automaticlaly save the documents from time to time. 


# Python - A free language 

## Introduction of Python
Python has became the top programming language recently. Not like traditional C or C++, python is a very high level language where almost all usually used functions are provided by either companies like google or individual contributers. So we have to bear in mind that packages may get wrong especially for some rarely used packages. It's always good to check carefully to make sure the results are correct. 

Python is very popular in industry, because it's free. Actually Matlab is better in terms of efficiency and well-designed packages. But the expense is just too high for some start-up companies. Learning python also improve the competitiveness in the job market.


## Choose python version 3.X 
Python mainly has three versions. The old version is 2.7 and the two new version are 3.6 and 3.7. I would recommend to use at least python 3.6. If you would like to risk some unstable issue (very rare to happen), the 3.7 version may be a better choice. My current version is 3.7 as I believe normally most packages will try to compatible with the newest version python. The 2.X version is significant different from 3.X version and it's very out of date as many latest version of packages like pandas and numpy don't officially support the python 2.X. Also the codes from python 2.X may not run successfully on 3.X for the code grammar changes (such as: 'print'). 

## 
The most popular tools for machine learning are TensorFlow (from Google), PyTorch and Theano, and apparently with top research and development ability, TenorFlow is always one of the most convenient tools. In 2019, the TensorFlow 2.0 perfectly merged with Keras which is a straightforward machine learning model packages. Now even a noval people with some basic computer science knowledges can built up his LSTM network in minutes. That's absolutely lower the entry barrier and make Machine learning convenient to more people.


## The choice of Python IDE

IDE provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development, and a proper IDE can make your coding much easier and faster. The most popular IDEs are PyCharm and Jupyter notebook. Jupeter notebook comes from iPython, creating the documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It's a perfect solution for presenting project and making the report. 

When it comes to real programming project which more than a hundred functions and .py files, it becomes not that friendly. PyCharm is a gem in Python Community. I used Visual Studio for C++ programming before, and PyCharm even excels in many perspectives. The professional version of PyCharm is free for all students and it offers the historical tracking records, code duplicates check, time consuming check et al.. It also support jupyter notebook so that you can create and edit jupyter file inside. The virtual environment is also easy to switch. 

All in all, why not to use PyCharm and make the life easier?  The jupyterLab maybe a alternative, but currently if not for some specific reason, PyCharm is still the best choice.
