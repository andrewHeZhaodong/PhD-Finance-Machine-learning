# PhD-Finance-Machine-learning

# Introduction
This project tries to include almost all necessary knowledge about doing a PhD in Finance using Machine learning. 

As machine learning rapidly merged with traditional social science, it's very attractive to apply Machine learning to finance field, especially prediction related problem.

Currently, it includes:
  1. The machine learning algorithm and intuitive applications
  1. Related mathematics algorithm. 
  1. Trading strategies
      1. Momentum Strategies
      1. Pair Trading Strategies
  1. Asset pricing 
      1. Retrieve data from WRDS
      1. Common risk factors and firm characteristics

# How to find related reference

Each research field has a trend. Traditional research area can directly search the published resources such as the web of science  (www.webofknowledge.com) to create the personal library. While for some newly established intersection research such as machine learning in finance filed,  papers tend to be in different areas. Publishing papers require a long time. Researchers would be more willing to published their working paper in some public database such as SSRN and arXiv before it's too late. 

Normally the machine learning in fiance papers can be mostly (not all) found in the following places:

1. Working papers in public database: SSRN(more finance papers), arXiv(more computer science paper) and some university-owned database(MIT, Chicago booth)

2. Journal paper:
    1. Expert System with Applications 
    

As papers are not published in the same journal, I would highly recommend using google scholar as the main reference management website. Of course, you may use the EndNote(Offered to Durham university students), Melody(Free) or other software. But google scholar for me is good enough to support every function required. 

Two functions are extremely useful in google scholar after you sign in your google account.
1. 'Labels': A tag-like button just below the search box. You may category your papers with this tool. Can help you manage the big amount of literature.
1. 'Related Articles': A button under the title of the paper. It may automatically research all related articles to this topic. The result may include all possible working papers, conference papers and journal papers from many fields in the most popular order. It can make one quickly grasp the recent trend and result of one topic.
1. 'Cite': A double-quotation-mark-like button. Generate multiple format citations for Bibtex, EndNote, et al. One can export multiple citations for selected papers by using the 'Export' button below the search box. As I don't use EndNote, the Bibtex format is the most used. 
1. 'Anytime': Some years listed in the left-hand side. We would have more cared about the recently 2 years papers or sometimes the latest published paper. This function filters papers by years. Normally papers within 5 years are comparably new and some working papers within one year are great to learn the hot topics and the most popular issues.
